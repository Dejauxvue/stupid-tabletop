stupid-tabletop help
====================



moving items
------------

Click and drag items to move them.
The changes are automatically visible to everybody looking at the same table.

Hold Shift and click to select multiple items.


looking around
--------------

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Drag the table to move your view.


adding items
------------

Press C to clone selected items.

Press A to add a new item with a new image.
You can paste the URL of any image on the web in the "image url" line.
If the item remains a grey square forever, the URL was not correct.


deleting items
--------------

Press Del or Backspace to delete selected items.


scaling items
-------------

Use the mouse wheel while holding Shift to scale selected items.


locking items
-------------

Locked items can not be selected, moved or scaled.
Double click to lock or unlock an item.


face-down items
---------------

Press F to flip an item (or all items in a pile) face-down.


piles
-----

Drop an item on another item of the same size to form a pile.
Note: The images used must have the exact same dimensions in pixels.
Only the topmost item can be removed from a pile.

To shuffle a pile, select it and press S.
You might want to flip the items face-down by pressing F first.

You can also select multiple items (hold Shift) and shuffle them into a pile.


private areas
-------------

In your private area, you see face-down items as if they were face-up.
To claim an item as your private area, select it and press M.
Double click on a private area to release it.


switching tables
----------------

Write any name in the "table name" line and hit "connect".
Names can contain letters, numbers, '-' and '_'.
If the name was never used before, a new blank table is created.
If "(not connected)" is shown forever, the table name may be invalid.

Any changes made while "(not connected)" is shown will be lost.




compatibility
-------------

Only tested with firefox so far.
