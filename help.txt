stupid-tabletop help
====================



moving items
------------

Click and drag items to move them.
The changes are automatically visible to everybody looking at the same table.

Hold Shift and click to select multiple items.


zooming in and out
------------------

Use the mouse wheel.
To move the view, zoom out and then zoom in to another region.


adding items
------------

Press C to clone selected items.

Press A to add a new item with a new image.
You can paste the URL of any image on the web in the "image url" line.
If the item remains a grey square forever, the URL was not correct.


deleting items
--------------

Press Del or Backspace to delete selected items.


scaling items
-------------

Use the mouse wheel while holding Shift to scale selected items.

Locked items can not be selected, moved or scaled.
Double click to lock or unlock an item.


face-down items
---------------

Press F to flip an item (or all items in a pile) face-down.


piles
-----

Drop an item on another item of the same size to form a pile.
Note: The images used must have the exact same dimensions in pixels.

Press S to shuffle a pile.
You might want to flip the items face-down by pressing F first.


switching tables
----------------

Write any name in the "table name" line and hit "connect".
Names can contain letters, numbers, '-' and '_'.
If the name was never used before, a new blank table is created.
If "(not connected)" is shown forever, the table name may be invalid.

Any changes made while "(not connected)" is shown will be lost.

Only tested with firefox so far.
